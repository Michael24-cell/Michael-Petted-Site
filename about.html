                <p>Michael Petted has been a dedicated acting teacher since <strong>2009</strong>, when he began teaching full-time at the renowned <strong>Beverly Hills Playhouse</strong>, where he spent ten years shaping the craft of hundreds of actors - ultimately teaching thousands through his classes, workshops, and international programs. The Playhouse is known for its celebrated alumni, including <strong>George Clooney</strong>, <strong>Michelle Pfeiffer</strong>, <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong>, <strong>Jorge Garcia</strong>, and <strong>Monica Barbaro</strong>, among many others.</p>
                
                <p>For eight years, Michael also served as the Head Acting Instructor for the <strong>Hollywood Immersive</strong> program, working with actors from around the world—including Australia, England, and Africa—helping them bridge the gap between training and professional work.</p>

                <p>Today, Michael teaches his own scene study and on-camera acting class at <strong>The Hudson Theatre in Los Angeles</strong>, where his passion for truth, artistry, and practical technique continues to inspire actors at every level - from complete beginners to seasoned professionals.</p>

                <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-amber-600">
                    Michael's students have gone on to work on acclaimed series and films including <strong>Yellowstone</strong>, <strong>The Promised Land</strong> (current series lead), <strong>And Just Like That</strong>, <em>A Big Bold Beautiful Journey</em>, <strong>American Horror Story</strong>, and <em>Far and Away</em> (Australia), among others. His classes focus on <strong>moment-to-moment work</strong>, using imagination and lived experience to create authentic, exciting performances - while also emphasizing the realities of a working career. Michael believes great acting comes from living truthfully, creating fearlessly, and turning craft into art one scene at a time.
