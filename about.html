                <p>Michael Petted has been a dedicated acting teacher since **2009**, when he began teaching full-time at the renowned **Beverly Hills Playhouse**, where he spent ten years shaping the craft of hundreds of actors - ultimately teaching thousands through his classes, workshops, and international programs. The Playhouse is known for its celebrated alumni, including **George Clooney**, **Michelle Pfeiffer**, **Alec Baldwin**, **Jorge Garcia**, and **Monica Barbaro**, among many others.</p>
                
                <p>For eight years, Michael also served as the Head Acting Instructor for the **Hollywood Immersive** program, working with actors from around the world—including Australia, England, and Africa—helping them bridge the gap between training and professional work.</p>

                <p>Today, Michael teaches his own scene study and on-camera acting class at **The Hudson Theatre in Los Angeles**, where his passion for truth, artistry, and practical technique continues to inspire actors at every level - from complete beginners to seasoned professionals.</p>

                <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-amber-600">
                    Michael's students have gone on to work on acclaimed series and films including **Yellowstone**, **The Promised Land** (current series lead), **And Just Like That**, *A Big Bold Beautiful Journey*, **American Horror Story**, and *Far and Away* (Australia), among others. His classes focus on **moment-to-moment work**, using imagination and lived experience to create authentic, exciting performances - while also emphasizing the realities of a working career. Michael believes great acting comes from living truthfully, creating fearlessly, and turning craft into art one scene at a time.
